              First, thanks for working through this today.  Some of you ran into issue that I did not hit, others found omissions/errors in the guide.

              I have made a few nginx config change, so please make sure to grab latest and restart nginx when you get in on Tuesday.

              Also, if you are still working through the setup process make sure to recheck the wiki as the guide has been updated as problems were found.
