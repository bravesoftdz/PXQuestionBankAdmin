            <description>What does the life of Louisa Cousselle reveal about women in the nineteenth-century trans-Mississippi West?</description>
            <tooltip>&quot;Reconstructing a Life in the West&quot; introduces students to a range of primary sources centered on the life of a nineteenth-century prostitute in the American West. Using these limited sources, students will piece together the known &quot;facts&quot; about Louisa Cousselle and then use this evidence to create a plausible account of Cousselle’s life—and by extension, those of other western prostitutes. Students will be able to understand and articulate that historical evidence is oftentimes neither neat nor complete. Thus, they will need to identify evidentiary gaps and employ strategies (verification, inference, reasonable speculation) for dealing with the missing pieces</tooltip>
