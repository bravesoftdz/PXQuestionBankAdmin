                <h1>Cache is OFF</h1>
                <p>Caching of content stored in BrainHoney as well any scripts, images, etc that are stored directly
 on PX web servers is now disabled. This will mean that any changes made to content will be immediately visible to
 you or other users of the system.</p>
		<p>Further, when you browse the site with cache turned off, you are effectively clearing the cache for other users. This is a useful way of clearing cache for specific content items for all users.</p>
